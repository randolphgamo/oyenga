## Introduction
Oyenga is a beautiful webapp that allows user to view gospel songs.
It is implemented using the MERN stack : it has a backend built with node that provides the api.
The frontend is built with React

## Relevant Concepts applied
In building this apps, I tackled the following concepts:
* Rest API building with Node and Express. 
* CRUD with MERN. Essentially the node backend has the ODM moongoose that works with the mongo db
* Authentication via jwt and bcrypt
* API & React route protection 
* React hooks (useState, useEffect, useRef and useReducer)
* React Context API


## Features
* beautiful website built with bootstrap
* Add a gospel song
* delete a gospel song
* update a gospel song
* Pagination (infinite scroll)
* admin can authenticate
* Search functionality


## Features to be added
* Song rating (similar to colorhunt palette)
* user profile management 
* suggest a new song which fires a mail to admin.
